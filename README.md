# Mission to Mars
## Webscraping wth HTMl and CSS
The purpose of this project was to use python libraries (flask, splinter, bs4, pandas, webdriver, and Pymongo), mongodb, html/css, to scrape the web for information on mars and present it on a webpage. Mongodb was used to store the information rather than a relational database due to the nature of the data being scraped from the web not having set key values.
